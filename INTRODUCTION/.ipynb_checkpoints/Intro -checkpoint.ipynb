    "All reports of suspected violations to the TOU, Community Code of Conduct or Honor Code should be submitted to report@udacity.com and will be reviewed. If you witness or are experiencing any violations of our policies \n",

    "    # Harassment: Inappropriate, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or violent comments or conduct.\n",
    "    # Discrimination: Offensive comments related to gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,\n",

    "coding experience. The other will apply to those of you who feel they need more time to build coding confidence.\n",

    "\n",
    "    The videos, text lessons, and quizzes you encounter in the classroom are optional but recommended. The project \n",
    "    at the end of this course will test your ability to apply the skills and strategies you have learned in the \n",
    "    classroom to real-world problems. It will also provide tangible outputs you can use to demonstrate your skills\n",
    "    for current and future employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The project is designed to be challenging. Many students initially struggle, but with a little grit,\n",
    "    they are able to learn from their mistakes and build their skills. Data from nearly 100,000 Udacity g\n",
    "    raduates show that commitment and persistence are the highest predictors of whether or not a student will graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    At some point, nearly every student will get stuck on a new concept or skill, and doubt may set in.\n",
    "    Don’t panic. Don’t quit. Be patient, and work through the problem. Remember that you are not alone and \n",

    "\n",
    "## How to Use Knowledge\n",
    "    To ensure you’re getting the quality and prompt support you need, it’s helpful to follow these best practices and guidelines     for Knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image of Mentor Help page\n",
    "* Search for Similar Existing Questions: with tens of thousands of students enrolled in our programs, many of your questions may have already been asked and answered. To look for existing answers to similar questions that may provide the immediate support you need, use the filter on the left side of your screen to select your course and related project or write in the key terms related to your question in the search bar at the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask a New Question: if you want to ask a new question, select “Ask a Mentor” at the top of the page. Kindly remember that Knowledge is for technical questions only; for other types of support and feedback, please write to support at support@udacity.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you ask a new question, the platform immediately assigns it to one of our expert mentors spread across the globe to ensure prompt replies. Of note, when a mentor answers your question, you will see “Mentor” next to their name to differentiate their support from comments your fellow learners may also provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Image of the Ask a Technical Mentor page \n",
    "If you don't see your question, simply create a new post. You are likely to get an answer within 24 hours and you'll be helping future students who may encounter the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Ask a Good Question?\n",
    "Students that follow these tips typically receive the strongest initial support and avoid back-and-forth with mentors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask Specific Questions: if you have closely related questions that form part of a general theme, it’s okay to ask them all together. But consider using bullet points to separately list each of the questions in your post. Keeping your questions organized helps ensure mentors provide clear answers to each specific question. If your questions are less closely connected, it’s best to submit new, separate questions for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide Details and Links: explaining what (if anything) you’ve already attempted to solve the problem helps mentors know where to start when answering your question. Likewise, if your question is not related specifically to a project, but rather to an exercise, quiz, or lesson, it’s helpful to include information such as lesson or quiz name, screenshots, and classroom links.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overall the key to asking a good question is to imagine yourself trying to answer your own question. Imagine you were coming to it without any prior knowledge. Does the question make complete sense? Or are there gaps around the context?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a Clear Question Title: attempt to summarize your entire question in one sentence. You may even write the title at the end, just before posting the question. This will help you summarize the issue before you include details in the question itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Share Code Correctly: by using the “Code Block” option to properly format your code. If your question concerns a piece of external code, include a link to the file on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In fact, Github lets you create a link to a specific line in a file. To do so, just click to the left of the line number, and then select copy permalink in the ellipsis that appears in the margin. Paste the permalink right into the Github box on your question submission form.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Figuring out Errors: if your question is about an error message or stack trace, include the entire error message, by either formatting the error message using the “Code Block” option or creating a Gist or a Paste on Pastebin, and including a link to it in the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid Screenshots of Code or Error Messages: do not use screenshots of code or error messages. They are hard to read and the text cannot be copied to debug it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you receive a helpful answer, kindly select it as the “accepted answer.” For questions from other students, if you see other helpful answers kindly select the “upvote” option. Conversely, if you don’t think an answer strongly answers a question, select the “downvote” option.\n",
    "Display of Upvoting for good answers and box checking for an accepted mentor response that fully answers your question\n",
    "* Getting Additional Support\n",
    "    At times, students want support from a different mentor. As everyone learns differently, we want to make this a simple \t\t\tprocess for learners like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "        If you receive an answer that you are not satisfied with and want a different mentor to chime in, kindly select the option at the top of the page in Knowledge. If you reply directly in the comments section, without clicking on the link at the top of the page, your question will not be answered by another mentor."

    "\tAny act claiming or implying another person’s work as your own.\n",

    "\n",

    "Taking a part of someone else's project and changing some variable and function names, - regardless of whether you give the source credit or not.\n",
    "* If you have not done the work yourself and attempt to mask it.\n",
    "Using Someone Else’s Code to Inform your Solution\n",
    "You should never knowingly view someone else’s work until you have completed the project yourself - nor should you share your project with someone who has not yet completed theirs. However, once you have completed your project, you are encouraged to see how other people have approached the same challenge in a different way. This allows you to compare your different strategies and ways of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Submitting Identical Works Post Collaboration\n",
    "    If you decide to work together with another student on a project, you are then expected to write your code separately. Submitting identical projects or submissions with identical portions is considered plagiarism as described in the Udacity Honor Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Seeking Help without violating the Honor Code\n",
    "    To be clear, you are encouraged to seek help by talking to Mentors on Knowledge, other students, and alumni. You’re also welcome to use frameworks and libraries to assist you, as long as they aren't removing important goals from the project that you should know how to do yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you are struggling and need help, we encourage you to ask technical questions on Knowledge to explore why your approach is not the correct approach. Mentors typically provide answers within an hour of questions being posted, so you can expect quick guidance on your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you’re ever in doubt as to whether or not something would be considered plagiarism, ask a Mentor on Knowledge. Our goal is for every student to graduate armed with a toolbox of skills that they can apply across a variety of concepts and problems. The best way to achieve this is to ensure every student does their own work and is able to demonstrate their skills in each project submission.\n",
