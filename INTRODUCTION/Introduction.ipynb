Community Guidelines

Your experience in the Nanodegree program and community should be an engaging, fulfilling, and positive one. As such, we have outlined the following system for reporting behavior that does not live up to Udacityâ€™s standards, so it can quickly be addressed by our staff.

All reports of suspected violations to the TOU, Community Code of Conduct or Honor Code should be submitted to report@udacity.com and will be reviewed. If you witness or are experiencing any violations of our policies please get in touch with us. Below prohibited actions as set forth on our Community Code of Conduct:

    Harassment: Inappropriate, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or violent comments or conduct.
    Discrimination: Offensive comments related to gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability or disease
    Distributing inappropriate content: Use of sexual, violent, graphic, or derogatory images
    Bullying: Deliberate intimidation, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person
    Sexual harassment: Unwelcome sexual attention
    Defamation: Obscene, fraudulent, indecent, or libelous acts that defame, abuse, harass, discriminate against or threaten others
    Plagiarism: will not cheat on any homework assignment, projects or exams for the Online Courses and, specifically, will not plagiarize materials created by others
    Self-injury or Suicide: We do not encourage posting in our student community about self-injury or suicide. If you or someone you know is exhibiting signs of self-injury or suicide, find help at the Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the U.S. and Befrienders.org globally.

When a potential violation is brought to our attention, we will make every effort to investigate the case thoroughly and make a decision that is fair to all parties.

Thank you, The Udacity Team


Lesson Plan

Udacity offers the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree to a wide range of students. As such, our students come from various backgrounds. Some of you will have had previous coding experience and some will have had none. For this reason we offer two suggested lesson plans. One lesson plan will apply to those of you with previous coding experience. The other will apply to those of you who feel they need more time to build coding confidence.

These suggested lesson plans will give you an idea of how to partition your time. You are of course encouraged to make your own judgement and enjoy the content at your own specific pace.
